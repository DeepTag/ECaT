## Unsupervised Exemplar-Based Image-to-Image Translation and Cascaded Vision Transformers for Tagged and Untagged Cardiac Cine MRI Registration.
We propose a fully unsupervised multi-modal medical image registration method based on image-to-image translation and cascaded vision transformers. We incorporate sample-specific style learning and hybrid global affine and local nonrigid deformation estimation in our framework and achieve significant superior performance over traditional methods.

## Demo
We aim to register an untagged cine MR (cMR) image to a tagged MR (tMR) image. The non-smooth contrast change between tMR and cMR, i.e., presence of tags, poses a great challenge to this task. We use the proposed method to first translate tMR to fake cMR; then, we register cMR to fake cMR using the NCC-based dissimilarity loss. Our method can learn the **specific image style** of each cMR frame to be registered and boost the multi-modal registration performance significantly. Note how the fake cMR frames can capture the individual image styles of the corresponding real cMR frames.
