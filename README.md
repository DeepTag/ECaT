## ECaT: Exemplar-Based Image-to-Image Translation and Cascaded Vision Transformers for Unsupervised Multi-Modal Medical Image Registration.

We propose a fully unsupervised multi-modal medical image registration method based on image-to-image translation and cascaded vision transformers. We incorporate sample-specific style learning in our framework and achieve significant superior performance over traditional methods.

Demo: (upper) tagging and unregistered cine image sequence; (middle) tagging and fake cine image sequence; tagging and registered cine image sequence. Our method can learn the image style of each frame and boost the registration performance significantly.
